The approach of outsourcing the construction and management of objects.

- App should be configurable
- Easily change the coach for another sport: Hockey, Cricket, Tennis, Gymnastics etc

```java
    public static void main(String[] args) {        // create the object
        // Coach theCoach = new BaseballCoach();
        Coach theCoach = new TrackCoach();        // use the object
        System.out.println(theCoach.getDailyWorkout());    }
```
